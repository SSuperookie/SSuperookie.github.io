#### 2022
I am new to this interdisciplinary subject, spending an unforgettable summer with 3D printing, PDMS materials, microfluidic devices and other novel things. In this project, our goal is to engineer flexible actuators based on electromagnetically actuated, pneumatic drive, and electrohydraulic. Users will wear actuators to conduct experiments in VR environments, and we will quantitatively evaluate the ability of each actuator to simulate inertial forces.

#### 2023
I joined the Electrotactile Group, which is working on an open-source device that enhances electrotactile through force-coupling. The device can be used in mouse, touch screen and VR/AR environments.

## Smile: Micro Campus Community WeChat Mini Program üì±
Me and my team members have built a WeChat mini program for sharing campus information. The mini program is dedicated to helping students quickly find solutions**<font color='#62D919'> (our identity and goals: ASAP) </font>** to their campus problems. In addition, we have also integrated ChatGLM-130B into this mini program, providing help and advice to students 24/7.
