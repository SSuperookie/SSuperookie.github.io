<br>
Here is **Yueyan Pang (Cathy, Â∫ûÊÇ¶Â¶ç)**.
<br>
I am a graduate student majoring in **Electrical Engineering** at Columbia University, focusing on neuroengineering and machine learning. 

<br>
<br>
I have a few experience in healthcare. My Graduation Project (Thesis) topic is *Wearable Environment Alert System with Sound Perception Technology for the Hearing Impaired*, advised by [Prof.Jian He, Beijing University of Technlogy](https://xueshu.baidu.com/scholarID/CN-BY75SSRJ).

<br>
<br>
I interned as a Product Manager at [Beijing Aeonmed Co., Ltd.](https://www.aeonmed.com/english.html) for Dec 2023 to Mar 2024. I am involved in the requirement analysis and interaction design of the [LUVAR Homecare CPAP Device](https://heyermedical.de/en/product/luvar/) software.
<br>
<br>
I also spent two lovely summers working on research projects of **haptic/tactile feedback** with [Prof. Teng Han](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=kHKwQ9gAAAAJ)'s team at Intelligence Engineering Lab (Beijing Key Lab of Human-Computer Interaction), Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
