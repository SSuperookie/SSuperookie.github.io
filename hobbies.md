<br>I have a deep love for music. I started learning the violin at the age of six and began studying the guitar in middle school. In high school music class, I also had the opportunity to try out the drum kit and the Chinese zither. In addition to playing instruments, I enjoy attending music festivals and spending memorable nights at jazz bars.

## Photography & Film

<br>Despite not having a glamorous plot, I enjoy collecting different types of cameras and bring them with me to capture moments in life. Kon Satoshi is my favorite director, his films not only have fantastic plots but also exquisite editing techniques. Under his influence, I have also started learning to edit the video clips I usually record into interesting [short films](https://space.bilibili.com/29753578).


## Developing Hobbies

Painting and Archery remove my worries, refreshing both my mind and body. Seemingly calm activities, bring me an exhilarating sense of immersion, and I am fascinated by them.
